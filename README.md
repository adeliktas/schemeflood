# schemeflood
The schemeflood technology is reproduced, and a few more domestic software fingerprints are added

[Online test](https://tomapu.github.io/schemeflood/)

After some feedback, the accuracy is not high enough, and Safari is not supported, and the [demo](https://schemeflood.com/) given by FingerprintJS is supported

The implementation of this project is simpler than the implementation code of the FingerprintJS demo, and it is more convenient for everyone to learn, but if you want to clarify more details and improve the robustness of the technology, please refer to [FingerprintJS code](https://github.com/ fingerprintjs/external-protocol-flooding)
